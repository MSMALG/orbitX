## Overview
This code represents the first version of our NASA Space Apps Challenge submission: **Galactic Games: Fun in a Microgravity Environment**!

### How it Works:
We’ve created a simple prototype (MVP) where an **astronaut’s suit** is simulated using a **cardboard box** equipped with an **ultrasonic sensor** and an **LED**. In the future, the LED will be replaced by a **vibration sensor** along with additional ultrasonic sensors for a more immersive experience.

The concept is simple: when an astronaut selects a game from our platform, the sensors on the suit will eventually connect via **Bluetooth** to a **VR headset** (planned for future development). Currently, this MVP demonstrates how the sensors will function. 

If the astronaut gets too close to a certain boundary (in this case, 30 cm), the suit should trigger a response. For now, we show this by switching on an LED when the sensor detects an object within 30 cm or less of distance. In the final version, this will trigger vibrations in the astronaut’s suit.
